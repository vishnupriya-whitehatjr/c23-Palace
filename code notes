In Physic Engine, Matter.js, We create triangles using a Polygon. 
Please refer this for syntax : https://brm.io/matter-js/docs/classes/Bodies.html

i.e; polygon(x,y,sides,radius)

But we are displaying using p5.js, so we use the concept of vertices, to display triangle,
Please refer this for syntax: https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/triangle

i.e; triangle(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)
  
    x1 Number: x-coordinate of the first point
    y1 Number: y-coordinate of the first point
    x2 Number: x-coordinate of the second point
    y2 Number: y-coordinate of the second point
    x3 Number: x-coordinate of the third point
    y3 Number: y-coordinate of the third point
